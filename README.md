# Fetch-AE-Project
 Fetch Rewards Coding Exercise - Analytics Engineer

Overview
This project involves reviewing and analyzing three Fetch datasets related to receipts, users, and brands. The goal is to model these datasets into a structured relational data model, write SQL queries to answer business questions, evaluate data quality issues, and communicate findings to stakeholders.

Deliverables
1. ER Diagram (FetchRewards_ER_Diagram.png)

2. SQL Queries and Outputs (SQLite in Jupyter Notebook)
- Top 5 brands by receipts scanned for most recent month
- Comparison of top 5 brands for the recent month and previous month
- Average spend comparison for 'Accepted' vs. 'Rejected' receipts
- Total number of items purchased for 'Accepted' vs. 'Rejected' receipts
- Brand with most spend for users created within the last 6 months
- Brand with most transactions for users created within the last 6 months

3. Data Quality Evaluation (Python in Jupyter Notebook)
Python code that identifies and describes data quality issues. This includes:
- Missing values
- Duplicates
- Data type issues
- Outliers
- Temporal Consistency

4. Communication to Stakeholders (in Jupyter Notebook)
A message covers:

Questions about the data
Discovery of data quality issues
Information needed to resolve issues
Performance and scaling considerations for production


Tools and Technologies
Python: For data cleaning and evaluating data quality issues
SQL: For querying and analyzing data
